        <b>  my first website is about <br>"WHAT IF YOU HAVE GIVEN ENOUGH TIME AND MONEY WHAT DO YOU DO".<br><br> For every person they have 
      their own ideas about their life,Every person should plan their next life what it should be You want to do something that may change your life style
      if you have time Money can give us the power to make a difference in the lives of others, but not the desire to do so.<br><br>
      Can give us the time to develop and nurture our relationships, but not the love and caring necessary to do so It can just as easily make us
       jaded, escapist, selfish, and lonely,How much do you need? What is it going to cost you to get it?
      is keeping these two questions in mind that gives us a true sense of money's relationship to happiness. If we have less than what we need, or if what
       we have is costing us too much, we can never be happy. We need money to eat, sleep, dress, work, play, relate, heal, move about, and enjoy comforts
        We should remember in choosing our style that it comes with a price tag.
